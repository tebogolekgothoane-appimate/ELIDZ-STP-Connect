### **Live Demo (5 minutes)**

#### **1. Registration & Authentication (30 seconds)**
> "First, let's see the registration process. Users can sign up with email and password, or use Google OAuth. Notice the professional branding with the ELIDZ logo. After registration, users receive an email confirmation - this ensures security. Once confirmed, they can log in and access all features."

**[Action: Show signup → email confirmation → login]**

#### **2. Product Lines & Services (1 minute)**
> "Now let's explore the product lines. Here's our Services page with all five STP facilities:
> - Food & Water Testing Lab
> - Design Centre
> - Digital Hub
> - Automotive & Manufacturing Incubator
> - Renewable Energy
> 
> Each facility has detailed information. But here's something innovative - **VR Tours**. Let me show you the Design Centre virtual tour. Users can navigate through 360-degree panoramas, click hotspots to move between scenes - it's like being there in person, even remotely.
> 
> Users can also request access or make enquiries directly from here."

**[Action: Navigate Services → Select facility → Show VR tour → Request access]**

#### **3. SMME Verification System (1 minute)**
> "For SMMEs, we've built a comprehensive verification system. SMMEs can upload required documents - Business Registration, ID Document, and Business Profile. The system tracks each document's status - pending, verified, or rejected. Only admins can approve verification.
> 
> Verified SMMEs can also list their products and services, making them discoverable to other users. This creates a marketplace within the app."

**[Action: Show profile → Upload documents → Show status → Products/services]**

---

#### **4. Networking & Messaging (1 minute)**
> "Here's our innovative connection system - think Facebook for professionals. Users can discover others by role, send connection requests, and only message after approval. This balances networking with privacy.
> 
> Once connected, users can message in real-time. Notice how messages update instantly - that's Supabase Realtime. Users can also attach files, documents, or videos. The unread count updates automatically."

**[Action: Show Network page → Send request → Accept → Send message with attachment]**

---

#### **5. Opportunities Platform (1 minute)**
> "The Opportunities page is comprehensive. Users can browse tenders, employment, funding, partnerships, and training opportunities. They can filter by category, search, and apply directly. This centralizes all STP opportunities in one place."

**[Action: Show Opportunities → Filter → View details → Apply]**

---

#### **6. Enquiry System (30 seconds)**
> "Finally, our enquiry system. Users can make structured enquiries about facilities, tenants, or general information. The form is context-aware - if you're viewing a facility, it pre-fills relevant information. All enquiries are tracked in the database for follow-up."

**[Action: Show enquiry form → Submit enquiry]**

### **Technical Highlights (1 minute)**

> "Let me highlight the technical excellence:
